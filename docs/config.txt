DBOOT.CONF Documentation
--------------------------------------

Terminology:
  - <ESP> : The EFI partition on your system, usually /boot
  - entry : A boot option that will appear in the GUI
  - group : A "folder" that contains multiple entries

Location:
  The DBOOT configuration file is located at: <ESP>/EFI/DBOOT/DBOOT.CONF


Structure
--------------------------------------
The config file is made up of entries, which have information on how DBOOT will handle them underneath the header.
An entry can be a child of a group, which is defined in it's own entry.

Defining an entry:
  To start a new entry you must define it's header by creating a new line with: '[NAME]', where NAME is what the entry will show up as in the GUI.
  Any options underneath this header, until a new entry is defined, will be parsed as belonging to it.

  To define an entry as part of a group, the header must contain: '[GROUP/NAME]', where GROUP is the name of the group that the entry will belong to.

Defining a group:
  Create a header just like any normal entry and define the 'type=group' option underneath. Any other options will be ignored.

Defining globals:
  Create a header just like any normal entry but leave the name blank: '[]'. Any non-global options under this header will be ignored.


Options
--------------------------------------
An option is a key-value pair that defines a characteristic of an entry. They are located below the entries' header.
For example: 'key=value'

Globals - Can be defined only under the globals header:
  - default : The name of the default entry that will be selected.
  - timeout : The time, in seconds, before the selected entry is automatically booted.
              If set to 'false' or any non positive integer, autoboot is disabled.

Generic - Can be defined in any boot entry:
  - type : The type of entry and boot protocol that will be used.
           Options: 'linux', or 'group'

Linux - Specific to Linux type entries:
  - kernel : The path to the kernel bzImage on the <ESP>
  - module : The path to the initrd / initramfs on the <ESP>
  - cmdline : The command line argmuents that will be passed to the kernel on startup.
